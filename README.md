In this Project, I practice using CSS Grid to layout the entirety of my page. Flexbox felt more intuitive to learn, but CSS Grid feels a lot more versatile. 
I discovered that every part of this page that I wanted to implement using Flexbox was possible to accomplish with Grid. 
I think that one of the most challenging parts to debug was my content body. I had set a ratio of 3:1 size ratio for the columns.  I used .75fr and .25fr for the values.
This caused my content body to snap to a smaller size when the page was resized to a smaller size.
So now instead of using fractions for fractional units, I will create the ratio using integers for fr values, like 3fr and 1fr.
